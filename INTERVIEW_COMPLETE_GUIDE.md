## 💬 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **1. Project Overview Questions**

**Q: What is the N-ary Tree Locking Algorithm?**
> "It's an algorithm that allows exclusive/shared access to tree nodes following these rules:
> - A node can be locked only if none of its ancestors or descendants are locked
> - Lock checking is O(log n) for ancestors, O(n) for descendants
> - Supports concurrent operations with thread safety"

**Q: Why did you choose this project?**
> "Tree locking is fundamental in:
> - Database systems (B-trees, indexes)
> - File systems (directory locking)
> - Distributed systems (hierarchical resource management)
> - Version control systems (Git uses tree structures)"

**Q: What real-world problems does it solve?**
> "It solves:
> - Concurrent file system access (directory locking)
> - Database index management
> - Resource allocation in hierarchical systems
> - Permission management in organizational structures"

### **2. Algorithm & Data Structure Questions**

**Q: Explain the algorithm in detail**
> "The algorithm has three main operations:
>
> **Lock(X, uid):**
> 1. Check if X is already locked
> 2. Check if any ancestor is locked (traverse up)
> 3. Check if any descendant is locked (traverse down)
> 4. If all clear, lock X for uid
>
> **Unlock(X, uid):**
> 1. Verify X is locked by uid
> 2. Release the lock
>
> **UpgradeLock(X, uid):**
> 1. Verify uid has locked all children
> 2. Unlock all children
> 3. Lock X for uid"

**Q: What's the time complexity?**
> "- Lock: O(m + log n) where m = number of children, log n = tree height
> - Unlock: O(1)
> - UpgradeLock: O(m) where m = number of children
> - Space complexity: O(n) for storing the tree"

**Q: How do you handle the descendant check efficiently?**
> "I maintain a descendant_locked_count for each node:
> - When locking a node, increment all ancestors' counts
> - When unlocking, decrement all ancestors' counts
> - This makes descendant check O(1) instead of O(subtree_size)"

### **3. Implementation Questions**

**Q: Show me the core data structure**
```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    string name;
    bool is_locked = false;
    int locked_by = -1;
    int descendant_locked_count = 0;
    weak_ptr<TreeNode> parent;
    vector<shared_ptr<TreeNode>> children;
};
```

**Q: Why use shared_ptr and weak_ptr?**
> "- shared_ptr for children: Automatic memory management, prevents leaks
> - weak_ptr for parent: Prevents circular references
> - This ensures proper cleanup when nodes are deleted"

**Q: How do you ensure thread safety?**
```cpp
class NaryTreeLock {
private:
    mutable mutex tree_mutex;

public:
    bool lock(string name, int uid) {
        lock_guard<mutex> guard(tree_mutex);
        // Thread-safe operations
    }
};
```

### **4. Edge Cases & Error Handling**

**Q: What edge cases did you handle?**
> "1. Locking already locked node
> 2. Unlocking node not owned by user
> 3. Invalid node names
> 4. Circular dependency prevention
> 5. Empty tree operations
> 6. Upgrading with unlocked children"

**Q: How do you handle concurrent access?**
> "- Mutex-based locking for thread safety
> - Operations are atomic (all-or-nothing)
> - No partial state changes
> - Reader-writer locks could be added for optimization"

### **5. Testing Questions**

**Q: How did you test the system?**
> "Multiple levels:
> 1. Unit tests for each operation
> 2. Edge case testing
> 3. Concurrent access simulation
> 4. Performance benchmarking (10,000 nodes)
> 5. Interactive web-based testing interface"

**Q: Show me a test case**
```cpp
// Test Case: Lock parent after child is locked
TreeNode* World = createNode("World");
TreeNode* Asia = createNode("Asia");
World->children.push_back(Asia);

lock("Asia", 1);     // Should succeed
lock("World", 2);    // Should fail (child locked)
```

**Q: What are your test results?**
> "- 15+ test cases all passing
> - Handles 10,000 nodes efficiently
> - Lock operation: ~1ms average
> - Memory usage: Linear with node count"

### **6. Performance & Optimization Questions**

**Q: How would you optimize for millions of nodes?**
> "1. Use memory pool for node allocation
> 2. Implement path compression
> 3. Add caching for frequently accessed paths
> 4. Use lock-free data structures
> 5. Partition tree for distributed systems"

**Q: How would you scale this for distributed systems?**
> "- Implement distributed locking (Zookeeper/Redis)
> - Use consistent hashing for node distribution
> - Add replication for fault tolerance
> - Implement two-phase locking protocol
> - Add transaction support"

### **7. Design Pattern Questions**

**Q: What design patterns did you use?**
> "1. **Singleton**: For tree manager (if needed)
> 2. **Factory**: For node creation
> 3. **Visitor**: For tree traversal
> 4. **Observer**: For lock state changes
> 5. **RAII**: For automatic lock release"

**Q: How would you extend this system?**
> "Add features like:
> - Read/Write locks (shared/exclusive)
> - Priority-based locking
> - Deadlock detection
> - Lock timeouts
> - Transaction support
> - Audit logging"

### **8. Specific Code Questions**

**Q: Show me the lock implementation**
```cpp
bool lock(const string& name, int uid) {
    auto node = findNode(name);
    if (!node) return false;

    // Check if already locked
    if (node->is_locked) return false;

    // Check ancestors
    auto current = node->parent.lock();
    while (current) {
        if (current->is_locked) return false;
        current = current->parent.lock();
    }

    // Check descendants
    if (node->descendant_locked_count > 0) return false;

    // Lock the node
    node->is_locked = true;
    node->locked_by = uid;

    // Update ancestor counts
    updateAncestorCounts(node, 1);
    return true;
}
```

**Q: Show me the upgrade lock logic**
```cpp
bool upgradeLock(const string& name, int uid) {
    auto node = findNode(name);
    if (!node || node->children.empty()) return false;

    // Check all children are locked by same user
    for (auto& child : node->children) {
        if (!child->is_locked || child->locked_by != uid)
            return false;
    }

    // Unlock all children
    for (auto& child : node->children) {
        unlock(child->name, uid);
    }

    // Lock parent
    return lock(name, uid);
}
```

### **9. System Design Questions**

**Q: How would you use this in a file system?**
> "- Each directory/file is a node
> - Lock directory before modifications
> - Prevent concurrent writes
> - Allow shared reads with read locks
> - Implement hierarchical permissions"

**Q: How would this work in a database?**
> "- B-tree index nodes use similar locking
> - Prevents phantom reads
> - Ensures ACID properties
> - Row-level vs table-level locking
> - Deadlock prevention strategies"

### **10. Frontend/Demo Questions**

**Q: Tell me about the visualization**
> "Built an interactive React interface that:
> - Visualizes the tree structure
> - Shows lock states with colors
> - Allows interactive lock/unlock operations
> - Displays performance metrics
> - Supports API testing"

**Q: Can we see it in action?**
> "Yes! I have:
> 1. Command-line demo with test cases
> 2. Web interface with tree visualization
> 3. API tester for custom operations
> 4. Performance benchmarks display"

> "Mutexes lock single resources. This handles hierarchical dependencies - you can't lock a parent if children are locked, and vice versa."

**Q: Real-world example?**
> "Google Drive folder sync: Can't modify a folder while files inside are being edited. Can't delete parent while child is open."

**Q: Why not use existing solutions?**
> "This is educational, showing understanding of:
> - Concurrent programming
> - Tree algorithms
> - System design
> - Performance optimization"
