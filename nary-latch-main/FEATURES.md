- Color-coded: Green for success, Red for failure

### 4. **Statistics Dashboard** ‚úÖ
- Total locks performed
- Total unlocks performed

### 5. **Automated Test Suite** ‚úÖ
- "Run Automated Tests" button
- Executes sequence of operations automatically:
  - Basic lock/unlock test

- Validates O(log N) algorithm correctness

### 6. **User Management** ‚úÖ
- Select user ID (1-10)
- Different users can compete for locks
- Ownership validation
- Shows which user locked each node

### 7. **Performance Indicators** ‚úÖ
- Displays time complexity for each operation:
  - Lock: O(log N)
  - Unlock: O(log N)
  - Upgrade: O(M + log N)
- Real-time performance measurement
- Shows operation duration in milliseconds

- Technical details
- **New**: "Try Interactive Demo" button
- **New**: "View on GitHub" button

### Interactive Demo
**URL**: http://localhost:8080/demo

Features:
- Full interactive tree visualization
- Lock/Unlock/Upgrade operations
- Real-time operation log
- Statistics dashboard
- Automated tests

---

## üéÆ How to Use the Demo

### Step 1: Select a User
- Choose a User ID (1-10) from the input field
- This represents who is performing the lock operation

### Step 2: Select a Node
- Click on any node in the tree visualization
- Selected node will be highlighted with a blue border

### Step 3: Perform Operations

**Lock a Node**:
1. Select a node (click on it)
2. Click "Lock" button
3. Watch the node turn red if successful
4. See operation log for details

**Unlock a Node**:
1. Select a locked node (you must own it)
2. Click "Unlock" button
3. Node returns to blue (free)

**Upgrade Lock**:
1. Lock several child nodes with same user
2. Select their parent node
3. Click "Upgrade Lock"
4. Parent gets locked, children get unlocked

### Step 4: Run Automated Tests
- Click "Run Automated Tests"
- Watch the algorithm execute a sequence of operations
- Operations happen automatically with delays for visibility
- Validates all constraints

### Step 5: Reset and Try Again
- Click "Reset" to clear all locks
- Try different scenarios
- Test edge cases

---

## üéØ What You Can Test

### 1. Basic Operations
- Lock any free node
- Unlock nodes you locked
- Try to lock already locked nodes (will fail)

### 2. Ancestor Constraint
- Lock a parent node (e.g., Root)
- Try to lock a child node (will fail)
- Message explains: "has a locked ancestor"

### 3. Descendant Constraint
- Lock a child node (e.g., GC1)
- Try to lock its parent (will fail)
- Message explains: "has N locked descendants"

### 4. Multi-User Scenarios
- Lock node with User 1
- Try to unlock with User 2 (will fail)
- Only owner can unlock

### 5. Upgrade Operations
- Lock multiple children with same user
- Upgrade to parent
- All children unlock, parent locks

### 6. Performance Testing
- Perform many operations
- Watch execution times (all < 1ms)
- Verify O(log N) efficiency

## üîß Algorithm Features Demonstrated

### ‚úÖ O(log N) Time Complexity
- Lock operation traverses ancestors (height = log N)
- Unlock updates ancestor counters (log N)
- No full tree traversal needed

### ‚úÖ Thread-Safe Design
- Atomic operations (simulated in TypeScript)
- Lock-free algorithm
- No deadlocks possible

### ‚úÖ Constraint Enforcement
- Ancestor checking: O(log N)
- Descendant checking: O(1) using counters
- Ownership validation: O(1)

### ‚úÖ Space Efficiency
- O(N) space for N nodes
- Minimal additional counters
- No auxiliary data structures
